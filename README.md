# openCV-ML-project
Holla! This is my #openCV face recoganisation project using #opencv-python in #python, which recoganised 
the person with his/her picture and take an attendence once the face recoganised.
It works in all worst condition of the webcam and take attendence one time when totally recoganised.

All you have to do is :
> just push the images of yours and anyone you want like your friends,family member 
>Then title the image with their respective names.
>Download all the modules first as mentioned in the source code then run the code
>Note: This works only on c++ visual compiler so download it from visual studio and install it simple.
>Run the code and surprise surprise!! the face will be recoganised by the python code and make you attended.
>Thats it , watch the video and like please.
